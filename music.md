So what do I do? Acoustic and electric music with a touch of world influence. My live show is a mix of guitar, ukulele, kalimba, and just about anything else I can find. I also use Ableton Live for an additional element here and there.

In addition to making music, I also make musical instruments. I got into kalimbas a few years ago, and started refining what I'd like in an instrument. My third iteration uses stainless steel tines and a heavy brass vice. It sounds dark. Amplification is courtesy of a simple external pickup assembly. I process it live with a Moog ring modulator to add in a little extra metallic resonance.
