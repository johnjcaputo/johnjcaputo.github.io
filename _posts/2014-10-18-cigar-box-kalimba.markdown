Last weekend's build was my first try at a box kalimba.   I've had quite a few solid bodies leave the workbench; but a box (while doable) just didn't meet my normal build hours.  In other words, when you only have a few minutes a night to fool around after the house is asleep, running power tools just doesn't work.  Enter the cigar box.  

I made a few modifications to my normal design to get this to really feel happening.   First, I'm using U channel for the vise.  Different, but it works.  I know this is popular in some circles.  The guys from Nomo make it an art.  It works well given the lightweight nature of the box.  But just strapping it to the box sounds terrible.  You get a muted tone with zero sustain.  Problem solved by gluing a solid block of wood under just about the entire top.  It's basically one of my solid body instruments with an integrated resonating bowl.  It works.  Well.  It also adds a bit of weight to the instrument in a good way.

Due to the rather wide tolerance when you order spring steel (stainless, of course), this guy ended up with some big tines.  This works since it ended up with a low C tuning.  That's basically as low as I got with a kalimba.  I used the Magic Hour tuning from the original hand pans.  It's awesome.  I'm planning to use it for next week's recording project.

The last item I wanted on this one was some buzzers.  I've played around with different buzzer materials and never found anything I really like.  Jump rings work great, and look clean, but they take too long to put on and off if you are feeling indecisive.  Enter my latest idea - 2mm ball chain.  Just hook it on and it buzzes away like mad.  Want it off, no problem.  Want it on and off?  Just tilt the kalimba forward and the chain rests against the tensioning bar.  You can move between buzzers and no buzzers in the middle of the song.  The curve also provides less buzz for the higher notes, which naturally have less tine to vibrate.  You end up with a lot of buzz on the low notes, and none on the highest.  Max buzz and max sustain.  Major win.

The next step is outfitting this guy with a piezo pickup.  The only thing better than a kalimba is a kalimba run through a bunch of Moog awesomeness.
