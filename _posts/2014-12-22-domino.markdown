Named after the box I built the kalimba out of.  Something different; one of my kalimbas and some samples of the random percussion instruments I have in my collection.  I detuned a lot of stuff; I was thinking taiko.  This has been hanging out for a few months, but tonight seemed like the right time to finish it up.
