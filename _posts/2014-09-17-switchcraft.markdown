Almost out of summer. Again. I leisurely put this tune together while I was putting my music room back together over the past several months. It reminds me of the laid back stroll that a good summer should have.

I have hopes of getting a few artists to put together some pseudo-praxinoscope discs and do a little animation with this one; but no sense in holding onto the music until that materializes. Guess I'll have to play a few records on my turntable in the meantime.

Switchcraft called out for oboe. No idea why; don't ask. I grabbed the sample on a whim and the part just wrote itself. There's a bit of Music in this one. Thanks, Vic.
