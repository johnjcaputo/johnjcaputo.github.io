"Who says you need to buy a guitar?"  What a great Jack White line.  This is my first scratch built cigar box guitar.   It's the first in a planned series of three, exploring different styles of construction.  Oak neck, Punch box, brass bridge and nut, two piezo pickups, and setup to play lap-style.  I marked the neck up mountain dulcimer style; I always thought that looked cool.  

I'm debating using this on a track I'm working on that's mostly kalimba and percussion.  We'll see what the week holds.  Gotta put together another track before I put together another guitar.
