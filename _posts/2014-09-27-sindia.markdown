And that's a wrap...on the warm weather in Pennsylvania, anyway. This is the first track I did with my [Ableton](http://www.ableton.com) Push, and I'm happy to say it sounds like my music. The Push is a huge workflow boost. I now believe the hype.

The Sindia is a shipwreck in Ocean City, NJ. You used to be able to see the mast poking out of the sand on the beach; but alas, it's no longer visible. It's the closest thing to a real life pirate ship that I remember as a kid. Granted, the Sindia was a merchant ship, but it all looks the same when you're four feet tall.

I named this track after that great childhood memory of summer. Hopefully that carries me through what promises to be another fridgid winter in PA.

The Push really let me nail the percuissive feel of the marimba and taiko, and both are very forward elements of this tune. My Zendrum is now dedicated to Hang; and it holds that task down admirably.
