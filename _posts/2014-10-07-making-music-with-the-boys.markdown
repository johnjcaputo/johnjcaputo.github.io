This project came about rather unexpectedly. While searching for kalimba making materials, I stumbled across a great resource for cigar box guitars. Which naturally led to the question, "can you build a guitar with a 2 year old and a 4 year old?"

It turns out that you can. And it was awesome. Instead of posting some music this week, I thought I'd post a finished picture of the build. I wish I had some in progress shots, but we were having too much fun to fool around with technology.

The boys put all the pieces in place and the big screws that hold the neck to the box. I did the small screws and then threw a pickup in after they went to bed.

I think it came out great. It's sounds awesome too. It has a very ghostly, lofi, voice with a glass slide.

If anyone wants to give it a try, [CB Gitty](http://www.cbgitty.com) has everything you could ever need, including some great kits to get going.

Future builds in the pipeline include a cigar box kalimba (in progress, with a few hiccups) and a cigar box amplifier.
