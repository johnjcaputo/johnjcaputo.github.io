<strong>Aloha.</strong>  I'm John; a musician, photographer, and educaitonal technologist from the Philadelphia area. If that doesn't cover enough ground, I also pretend that I know what I'm doing being a parent and husband.

<strong>Stuff I make:</strong> Kalimbas, stuff with cigar boxes, Legos

<strong>Stuff I eat:</strong> Sushi, chili dogs, wheat berries, kimchi, and anything I can put in my Vitamix.
